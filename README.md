# Binary-Classification

"binary_classifier.py" trains multiple binary classifiers using the fetch_covtype dataset. This example demonstrates the functionality of the "binary_classification.m" module for evaluating the performance of binary classifiers.

The module first generates random predictions for the positive and negative classes using a normal distribution. The results are displayed below:

For the trained classifiers, you can select the 'load data' option. For instance, for the Logistic Regression classifier, we obtain:

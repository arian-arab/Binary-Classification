# Binary-Classification

"binary_classifier.py" trains several binary classifiers using fetch_covtype dataset. This is just an example to illustrate the "binary_classification.m" module for performance evaluaiotn of binary classifiers.

The module first simulates random predicitons using normal distribution for positive and negative classes. Results are shown below:

For the trained classifiers, you can use the option "load data". For example, for the Logistic Regression classifier we get:
